# Linear-Algebra-Notes

**Linear Algebra: The Foundation of Data Science ğŸ“ˆ ğŸ“Š**

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations, matrices, and vectors. It is a fundamental tool for data scientists, as it is used in many different data science tasks, such as:

* **Data preprocessing:** Linear algebra can be used to clean and transform data, such as by normalizing data or removing outliers. ğŸ§®
* **Data visualization:** Linear algebra can be used to create visualizations of data, such as scatter plots or line graphs. ğŸ“ˆ
* **Machine learning:** Linear algebra is used in many machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression and logistic regression. ğŸ’¡

In short, linear algebra is an essential tool for data scientists. If you are interested in a career in data science,
I highly recommend that you learn linear algebra. ğŸš€
